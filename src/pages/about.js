                <h4>I am currently a 3rd year student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute working towards
                    a bachelor's of science in mathematics and computer science. I have strong interests in full stack
                    development, data science, and software engineering and would love to explore those in depth.

                <h4>Over the past year, the coronavirus has disrupted a lot of the activities I like, but once it is over, I hope to
                    be able to play club tennis and/or badminton. Beyond sports, I also like to code side projects and listen to music in my free time. My
                    favorite types of music are City Pop, kay≈çkyoku, and enka. My favorite TV shows are Breaking Bad and Better
                    Call Saul and my favorite movie is Parasite. I also enjoy playing video games, primarily grand strategy games such
                    as Europa Universalis IV and Hearts of Iron IV.
