I had always been around\n                     computers, whether through video games, watching youtube, or doing\n                     classwork. Choosing computer science as my major was a no-brainer for me.\n                     <br/><br/>\n                     Heading to college, though I know what I wanted to do but\n                     I never really understood what the field entailed. To me, it was about the \"what\"\n                     the sleek websites or cool games but not so much the \"how\" of how everything works.\n                     Learning about how data structures work or how to make optimize programs through\n                     algorithms really opened my eyes to the depth of the field. I never understood beforehand\n                     how important math was. The foundation of computer science is built on math and\n                     to better my abilities in computer science, I also chose to pursue mathmatics as my dual major.\n                     <br/><br/>\n                     Outside college classes, I have also sought to pursue my own personal projects and open source\n                     group projects which you can explore further in the Portfolio section. I always look for opportunities\n                     in which I can apply what I learn and take skills beyond the classroom. I have also pursued\n                     leadership roles throughout my life such as being the member coordinator as well as the interim\n                     secretary for a mandarin club. Having been a Eagle Scout, I have plenty of experience leading\n                     peers to solving real world problems and coordinating volunteer projects.\n                     <br/><br/>\n                     Throughout my journey, I have faced many struggles and obstacles. I am not naturally good at the\n                     vast majority of things and there are many classes in which I have struggled in. However, I have\n                     always been able to put in the time and effort to solve a problem even if my peers did not have to.\n                     I am always motivated and determined to push through any problem. I am not above using the occassional\n                     brute force to solve a problem that needs to be solved. I always seek to solve every problem I'm given\n                     and try to excel at everything I do and apply myself.\n                </h2>\n                <h1 class = \"title\">Personal</h1>\n                <h2>I was born in a small town in central China. I spent the first four years of my life living\n                    with my grandparents as my parents were in Singapore finishing their degrees. At age 4, I left\n                    China to join my parents in Singapore. I would only spend around 4 years in Singapore but those\n                    4 years hold a special place in my heart. I remember the hot\n                     and humid summer days, the wet sand of the beaches, and visiting all the zoos, science centers,\n                     and night safaris. I remember have to rush\n                     to endless tutoring classes, being locked in a dark closet \n                    by a teacher as discipline for my misbehavior, and having my hands slapped with a ruler by my parents\n                    for not recognizing that the golden arches of McDonalds was the letter 'M'. Ultimately I had to leave\n                    Singapore when I was 8 to go to America but I hope I will revisit it one day.\n                    <br/><br/>\n                    Coming to America was a major culture shock from my childhood in the east. I had to relearn English\n                    to rid myself of the heavily accented Singaporean English. I had to adapt to cold climate of the\n                    American northeast. As I was very young, I was a quick adapter. I was Americanized very quickly,\n                    picking up American mannerisms, the American cuisine, and American culture. I would eventually be\n                    naturalized as a US citizen in 2019.\n                    <br/><br/>\n                    In school, I had always excelled in math. Though I was never the athletic type, I eventually went\n                    to pick up tennis where I made it to the varsity team. I also enjoyed skiing as well as badminton\n                    whenever I visited China during the summers. I suffered a bad knee injury and haven't been able to\n                    play sports but I have gotten surgery and once the coronavirus blows over, I hope to reengage with\n                    either badminton or tennis. Beyond sports, I also like to code and listen to music on my free time. My\n                    favorite types of music are City Pop, Kayōkyoku, and enka. My favorite TV shows are Breaking Bad and Better\n                    Call Saul and my favorite movie is Parasite.\n                </h2>\n                <br/>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default About;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/resume.78fd64e1.pdf\";","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport resume from '../resume.pdf';\n\nclass Resume extends Component{\n    render(){\n        return (\n            <embed src = {resume} type = \"application/pdf\" class = \"resume\"/>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Resume;","import './App.css';\nimport {BrowserRouter, Route, Switch} from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Home from './pages/home';\nimport Contact from './pages/contact';\nimport Portfolio from './pages/portfolio';\nimport Education from './pages/education';\nimport About from './pages/about';\nimport Resume from './pages/resume';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <BrowserRouter>\n      <html>\n        <head>\n          <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat' rel='stylesheet'/>\n        </head>\n        <body>\n          <div class = \"header\">\n            <div class = \"inside_header\">\n              <div class = \"name\">\n                <a href = \"/\"><h1>Suhan Gui</h1></a>\n              </div>\n              <ul class = \"nav\">\n                <a href = \"/resume\"><li>Resume</li></a>\n                <a href = \"/about\"><li>About</li></a>\n                <a href = \"/education\"><li>Education</li></a>\n                <a href = \"/portfolio\"><li>Portfolio</li></a>\n                <a href = \"/contact\"><li>Contact</li></a>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </body>\n      </html>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route path = \"/\" exact component = {Home}/>\n        <Route path = \"/resume\" exact component = {Resume}/>\n        <Route path = \"/about\" exact component = {About}/>\n        <Route path = \"/education\" exact component = {Education}/>\n        <Route path = \"/portfolio\" exact component = {Portfolio}/>\n        <Route path = \"/contact\" exact component = {Contact}/>\n      </Switch>\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
