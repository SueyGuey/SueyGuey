                <h2>Even from a young age, I have never had a doubt
                     about what I path I wanted to pursue. I had always been around
                     computers, whether through video games, watching youtube, or doing
                     classwork. Choosing computer science as my major was a no-brainer for me.
                     <br/><br/>
                     Heading to college, though I know what I wanted to do but
                     I never really understood what the field entailed. To me, it was about the "what"
                     the sleek websites or cool games but not so much the "how" of how everything works.
                     Learning about how data structures work or how to make optimize programs through
                     algorithms really opened my eyes to the depth of the field. I never understood beforehand
                     how important math was. The foundation of computer science is built on math and
                     to better my abilities in computer science, I also chose to pursue mathmatics as my dual major.
                     <br/><br/>
                     Outside college classes, I have also sought to pursue my own personal projects and open source
                     group projects which you can explore further in the Portfolio section. I always look for opportunities
                     in which I can apply what I learn and take skills beyond the classroom. I have also pursued
                     leadership roles throughout my life such as being the member coordinator as well as the interim
                     secretary for a mandarin club. Having been a Eagle Scout, I have plenty of experience leading
                     peers to solving real world problems and coordinating volunteer projects.
                     <br/><br/>
                     Throughout my journey, I have faced many struggles and obstacles. I am not naturally good at the
                     vast majority of things and there are many classes in which I have struggled in. However, I have
                     always been able to put in the time and effort to solve a problem even if my peers did not have to.
                     I am always motivated and determined to push through any problem. I am not above using the occassional
                     brute force to solve a problem that needs to be solved. I always seek to solve every problem I'm given
                     and try to excel at everything I do and apply myself.

                <h1 class = "title">Personal</h1>
                <h2>I was born in a small town in central China. I spent the first four years of my life living
                    with my grandparents as my parents were in Singapore finishing their degrees. At age 4, I left
                    China to join my parents in Singapore. I would only spend around 4 years in Singapore but those
                    4 years hold a special place in my heart. I remember the hot
                     and humid summer days, the wet sand of the beaches, and visiting all the zoos, science centers,
                     and night safaris. I remember have to rush
                     to endless tutoring classes, being locked in a dark closet 
                    by a teacher as discipline for my misbehavior, and having my hands slapped with a ruler by my parents
                    for not recognizing that the golden arches of McDonalds was the letter 'M'. Ultimately I had to leave
                    Singapore when I was 8 to go to America but I hope I will revisit it one day.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Coming to America was a major culture shock from my childhood in the east. I had to relearn English
                    to rid myself of the heavily accented Singaporean English. I had to adapt to cold climate of the
                    American northeast. As I was very young, I was a quick adapter. I was Americanized very quickly,
                    picking up American mannerisms, the American cuisine, and American culture. I would eventually be
                    naturalized as a US citizen in 2019.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In school, I had always excelled in math. Though I was never the athletic type, I eventually went
                    to pick up tennis where I made it to the varsity team. I also enjoyed skiing as well as badminton
                    whenever I visited China during the summers. I suffered a bad knee injury and haven't been able to
                    play sports but I have gotten surgery and once the coronavirus blows over, I hope to reengage with
                    either badminton or tennis. Beyond sports, I also like to code and listen to music on my free time. My
                    favorite types of music are City Pop, Kay≈çkyoku, and enka. My favorite TV shows are Breaking Bad and Better
                    Call Saul and my favorite movie is Parasite.
